# AIAE Migration Log

Evidence record for [`aiae-migration-plan.md`](./aiae-migration-plan.md). One row per phase,
appended in the same commit as the work. A phase is not complete until its row exists.

**This log is authoritative over the plan for any measured number.** The plan's §0 lists
which of its figures were carried from the audit unverified; every one of those is replaced
below by a measured value.

## P0 — Baseline · *in progress*

Measured 2026-08-10 against `c53a76d` (pre-migration baseline), branch `migration`.

### Environment — read this before running anything

| Tool | Found | Expected by the project | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `python` | 3.14.5 | — | real interpreter |
| **`python3`** | **Windows Store stub** | a real Python 3 | **see below — this silently disables gates** |
| `mvn` | **absent** | Maven | backend build/test/coverage cannot run here |
| `java` | 25.0.3 | **21** | untested against the build |
| `node` | 24.16.0 | 22 (CI) | untested against the build |
| `bash` | 5.2.37 (msys) | — | fine |

**The `python3` stub is the single most dangerous thing in this environment.** It accepts
stdin, prints `Python`, and exits **0**. Ten of the 28 checkers embed
`python3 - "$@" <<'PY'`, and `verify-gates.sh` itself calls `python3` directly at lines 187,
194, 198 and 201. Run the suite without fixing this and those checks report success having
read nothing — the exact "green because the check does not run" failure the plan forbids.

The plan's §P0 wording ("use an explicit interpreter for the Python gates") is not
sufficient: the invocation is *inside* the scripts, so it cannot be overridden from the call
site. `python3` must resolve to a real Python before anything is run. Verified fix used for
this baseline: copy the real `python.exe` to a directory named `python3.exe` and prepend
that directory to `PATH` in POSIX form (`/c/...`, not `C:/...` — bash will not parse the
latter as a PATH entry).

**Not measured, and why:** `mvn -f backend/pom.xml -Phandoff verify` and the backend test
suite. Maven is not installed on this machine. The coverage measurement that P9 step 1
depends on is therefore still outstanding, and P9 cannot start until someone runs it.

### Gate baseline

Run from the project root against a scratch copy of `cc64e49`'s
`templates/generated-project/scaffold/scripts/`, with a working `python3`.
Scanners that take source roots were given them explicitly, as `verify-gates.sh` does.

| `check-openapi-strict-schemas.sh` | 0 | — | ✅ |
| `check-architecture-overview.sh` | 1 — missing section `Document status` | 1 | ✅ |
| `check-agent-surfaces.sh` | mode = `handoff` (AGENTS.md / replit.md / `.agents` absent) | — | P1 outstanding |
| `check-maven-dependency-analysis.py` | invocation-dependent — reports "no backend pom" when given `.` | 1 | resolve in P2 |

**The audit measured honestly.** Sixteen of seventeen comparable figures reproduce exactly.

### Correction — `check-production-current-time` is 3, not 2

The third violation is in a file no phase currently touches:

```
service/common/time/CurrentTime.java:21   return LocalDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC);
service/common/time/CurrentTime.java:30   return Instant.now();
external/storage/impl/CloudFrontUrlSigner.java:56   .expirationDate(Instant.now().plus(expiresIn))
```

P8 step 2 splits `CurrentTime` into an interface plus `CurrentTimeImpl`, which addresses the
first two. **`CloudFrontUrlSigner` is a separate fix** — it must take the injected
`CurrentTime` instead of calling `Instant.now()` directly. P8's exit criterion is 3 → 0.

### R1 — settled

Query run against production 2026-08-10:

```sql
SELECT orderexecuted, id, author, filename, exectype
FROM   databasechangelog ORDER BY orderexecuted;
```

Result: `filename = db/changelog/1.0.0/db.version-master.xml` — the classpath path, carrying
neither `backend/db` nor `backend/migrations`.

**§2.1 confirmed. R1 does not exist.** The module rename is invisible to Liquibase because
the recorded filename is resolved from the classpath root (`src/main/resources`), which the
Maven module directory name is not part of. P5 proceeds with no `logicalFilePath` pin and no
`changelogSync`.

### A retracted finding, recorded so it is not rediscovered

Running the scanners bare from a scratch directory makes them print
`no source directories to scan` and exit **0**. This is not a defect: with no arguments they
`cd` to `SCRIPT_DIR/../..` and scan the scaffold they live in. Invoked through
`verify-gates.sh` — or with explicit source roots, as above — they behave correctly. Do not
"fix" this.

### R5 spike — answered, and it is not a deadlock

Run 2026-08-10 in a scratch copy of `frontend/`, variant A only.

```
vitest  ^3.2.6  -> resolved 3.2.7
vite    ^5.4    -> resolved 5.4.21
@vitejs/plugin-react ^4.3.4
```

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | **430 packages, no peer conflicts** |
| `npm run generate:api` | ok |
| `npm run build` | **✓ built in 10.23s** |
| `npm test` | **22 files, 78 tests, all passed** |

Tiptap 3.22, `@base-ui/react` and `@tsparticles/confetti` all work under Vite 5.
**CR-6 is not needed and should be withdrawn.** P12 takes the standard's pins as written.

Variant B (`vite ^6`) was designed as the fallback if A failed. A did not fail, so B was not
run — it could only have produced a smaller downgrade nobody now needs.

Two notes for later, neither blocking:
- The first build attempt failed with `TS2307: Cannot find module './generated/schema'` and a
  cascade of `TS7006`. That is the gitignored OpenAPI output, not a Vite problem —
  `npm run generate:api` must precede `npm run build` on any clean tree.
- The build emits a **662 kB** `SimpleEditor` chunk (tiptap), over Vite's 500 kB warning
  threshold. Record it as the bundle baseline in P12.

### Frontend product baseline — and the cost of the downgrade

`npm ci && npm test` on the tree as it stands, and the same on the spike copy:

| Toolchain | Tests | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **current** — vite 8.1.4 / vitest 4.1.10 | **22 files, 78 tests, all pass** | **5.6s** |
| after P12 — vite 5.4.21 / vitest 3.2.7 | 22 files, 78 tests, all pass | **52.1s** |

**Zero test regression** from the downgrade — the same 78 tests pass on both. But the suite
runs roughly **nine times slower** on the pinned toolchain. Neither source document mentions
this, and it is a real recurring cost: every phase after P12 pays it on every run, and with
no CI the local suite is the only thing that runs at all.

Not a reason to reverse the decision — the `vitest ^3.2.6` pin is gate-enforced and the
template is read-only. It is a reason to raise it upstream: CR-6 was written for a
compatibility deadlock that did not materialise, and can be **repurposed** to report the
performance cost of the mandated pin instead of withdrawn outright.

### Still outstanding in P0

| Step | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — branch `migration` from `1.0.0` | done — `c53a76d`, `adc9f49`, `4d9b187` |
| 1a — `CLAUDE.md` guardrails | done — `c5cb107` |
| 1b — commit-message template | outstanding — the evidence-contract trailer is not yet written down |
| 1c — this log | done |
| 2 — working-tree state confirmed | done — `backend/db` gone, `backend/migrations` present, Lombok still absent from its POM |
| 3 — gate baseline | done, above |
| 3a — R1 query | done, above |
| 4 — product baseline | frontend **done** (78/78, above); backend **blocked — Maven not installed** |
| 5 — send change requests upstream | outstanding — owner's action |
| 6 — standard checkout reachable at `cc64e49` | done — all required paths present |
| 7 — R5 spike | **done — variant A passes; CR-6 withdrawn** |

## Carried red assertions

Every phase's evidence must show these unchanged. A count that moves without a decision
recorded here is a defect.

| # | Assertion | Expected | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `verify-gates.sh` presigned upload | exactly **1** | CR-1 |
| 2 | `check-frontend-ui-rules.sh` | **2222** | §6 — no frontend visual work |
| 3 | `verify-gates.sh` sidebar | fails | §6 / CR-2 — navigation preserved |
| 4 | `structure-lint` `changes/0001-usage-events.xml` | fails | §2.7 / CR-8 — telemetry kept |
